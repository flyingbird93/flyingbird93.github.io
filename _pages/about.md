I'm a lecturer from [School of Computer Science](https://jsjxy.hbuas.edu.cn/), [Hubei University of Art and Science](https://www.hbuas.edu.cn/). My research interest includes computer vision, machine learning, and computational photography.
I am very fortunate to be graduated by [Prof. Aimin Hao](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1078/2654.htm) of [VR Lab](https://vrlab.buaa.edu.cn/) from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/index.htm), Beihang University.


I am an Assistant Professor at the [School of Computer Science](https://jsjxy.hbuas.edu.cn/), [Hubei University of Art and Science](https://www.hbuas.edu.cn/). Before joining HUAS, I obtained my Ph.D. degree from [VR Lab](https://vrlab.buaa.edu.cn/) from [School of Computer Science and Engineering](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/index.htm), Beihang University, advised by [Prof. Aimin Hao](https://scse.buaa.edu.cn/info/1078/2654.htm). I obtained my master degree from the department of Automation, North China Electric Power University, supervised by Prof. Ximao Chang.

My research interests cover computer vision, deep learning, and artificial intelligence, with special emphasis on generative models and multimodal AI. I am also interested in their applications in image aesthetic assessment and enhancement. I was awarded Beihang University Academic Scholarship 2018, 2019, 2020, Outstanding Intern of BUAA Qingdao Research Institute and Shenzhen Pengcheng Postdoctoral Forum Excellent Poster Award 2022.

I am actively looking for self-motivated undergraduate and postgraduate students, research assistants, and visiting students to join my group. Please drop me an email if you are interested.  Due to the large number of emails I received, I cannot reply to all of them. But I do read all emails and reply to those that I am interested in. There's no need to send duplicate emails.
